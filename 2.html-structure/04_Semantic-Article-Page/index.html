                An <b>apple</b> is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple
                tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and
                are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
                The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
                Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown
                for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to
                North America by European colonists.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
                Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian
                traditions.
